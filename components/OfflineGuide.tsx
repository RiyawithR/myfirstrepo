                <li><strong>3. Don't Break Blisters:</strong> If blisters form, do not break them as this can lead to infection.</li>
                <li><strong>4. Apply Lotion:</strong> Once cooled, apply a moisturizing lotion, like one with aloe vera.</li>
                <li><strong>5. Bandage:</strong> Cover the burn with a sterile gauze bandage (not fluffy cotton).</li>
